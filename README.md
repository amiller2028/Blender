# BlenderPresets
A collection of my custom Blender settings, themes n shit

## NOTE: Currently all my settings are for blender 2.79

## Installation instructions
1.  Browse to your roaming directory, you can type in %appdata% in file explorer to easily navigate there.
2.  Locate and open your Blender folder in the roaming folder *Roaming/Blender Foundation/Blender
3.  In this folder should be the versions of blender that you have installed. In order to replace the preferences you will need to delete or rename the folder >2.79<.
4.  Now clone this repository in the blender folder, this can be achieved by opening CMD, Powershell, Git Bash... etc and typing in >git clone https://github.com/amiller2028/Blender
Now when you open blender you should have the new user settings and themes. Enjoy!
