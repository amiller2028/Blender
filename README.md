# BlenderPresets
A collection of my custom Blender settings, themes n shit. It makes the controls for navigation more like unity with an additional option to orbit around the selected objects. Dark theme with purple accents, your welcome Morgon.

## NOTE: Currently all my settings are for blender 2.79

## Unity Preferences Mouse Controls
* Left click: Box Select
* Shift + Left Clcik: Box Deselect
* Right Click: Orbit
* Middle Mouse Button: Pan

## Installation instructions
1.  Browse to your roaming directory, you can type in %appdata% in file explorer to easily navigate there.
2.  Locate and open your Blender folder in the roaming folder *Roaming/Blender Foundation/Blender
3.  In this folder should be the versions of blender that you have installed. In order to replace the preferences you will need to delete or rename the folder "2.79".
4.  Now clone this repository in the blender folder, this can be achieved by opening CMD, Powershell, Git Bash... etc and typing in "git clone https://github.com/amiller2028/Blender"
Now when you open blender you should have the new user settings and themes. Enjoy!
